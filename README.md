### Project Overview

 The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Throughout this project, we will explore the Olympics dataset(scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), look at some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, we will have a better understanding of data handling with python(pandas). In this project, we will be applying the following concepts :

Dataframe operations

Conditional statement and loops

List operations

Bar Plotting

Mathematical operations


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project, I have used various python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib which helps us find the answer to different problem statements. These libraries give us different methods to conquer the solution to these problems.


### Challenges faced

 In this project, I faced many challenges just like how to do the dataframe operations, conditional operations, use loops along with some visualization concepts like plotting graphs.


### Additional pointers

 I have also used functions to solve some of my problems.
